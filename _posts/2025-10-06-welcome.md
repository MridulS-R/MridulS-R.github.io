## System Design 101

- System Desing is a process of completly understanding the archituctue , design and utilise the resources in such a way that it should be a optimal solution to the requirment or the scenrios.

- Question might arise in 2025, In the era of AI why do we need to understnad the System Design and its principles: Answer is very simple to design the ai architucture or any ai module or its APU(Artifical Processing Unit) you should first understand the building block of System design or Architucture.

So what we would cover in these series of blogs

- CAP Theorem
- ACID Transactions
- Consistent Hashing
- Rate Limiting
- SPOF
- Fault Tolerance
- Consensus Algorithms
- Gossip Protocol
- Service Discovery
- API Design
- Disaster Recovery
- Distributed Tracing
- APIs
- Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Proxy vs Reverse Proxy
- Domain Name System (DNS)
- Caching
- Caching Strategies
- Distributed Caching
- API Gateway
- Load Balancing
- Databases Types
- SQL vs NoSQL
- Database Indexes
- Consistency Patterns
- HeartBeats
- Circuit Breaker
- Idempotency
- Database Scaling
- Data Replication
- Data Redundancy
- Database Sharding
- Database Architectures
- Failover
- Bloom Filters
- Message Queues
- WebSockets
- Checksums
- Microservices Guidelines
- Distributed Locking

And After this we would see some examples of realtime appication with rails and will create bottleneck and how we can resolve this
